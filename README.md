GenSong
=======

Dual algorithmic music generator 

GenSong is a SuperCollider application that creates two different types of music: A finite length dubstep track and an infinite length house/techno piece. In each case variations in the structure are determined by a mixture of random and informed decisions, implemented through weighted probabilities and methods such as Markov chains. 

Some examples:
